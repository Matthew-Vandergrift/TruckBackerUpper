# TruckBackerUpper
Truck Backer Upper (TBU) is an environment for sequential decision making experiments. There are two versions
of this environment, the continous and the discrete version. 

## TBU Gym
This is an implementation of the TruckBackerUpper environment using the gymnasium API, both discrete and continous versions have gymnasium implementations. 

## TBU Jax
This is an implmentation of the TruckBackerUpper environment using in the style of gymnax environments. Both the continous and discrete verisons are implemented in this style. 

## Example1
This is an example of running SAC, as implemented by Stablebaselines3, on the Gymnasium Truck Backer Upper Continous environment. 

## Example2 
This is an example of running a random uniform policy on the gymnax TBU discrete environment.

## Tests
This is not yet finished code to ensure that both version remain indentitcal up to stochasticity.
